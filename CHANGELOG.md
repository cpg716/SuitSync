## [Unreleased] - 2025-07-07

### Added
- Unified sync status in header now lists all resources (customers, users, products, sales) with individual status and last sync time.
- Backend `/api/lightspeed/health` always returns all expected sync resources, even if never synced.
- API health and error info now included in sync status response.
- Windows migration instructions and Docker compatibility notes.

### Avatar & Identity Model
- Avatar pipeline fixed: resolve Lightspeed image fields (`image_source` ‚Üí `photo_url` ‚Üí `avatar`) in session and users API; frontend falls back to initials/icon.
- Identity model clarified: all users are Lightspeed identities; local DB augments with availability, commission, skills, and audit only (no standalone local accounts).

### Fixed
- Customer list now sorts by last name (with missing last names at end), displays as `Last Name, First Name`.
- Search by last name, first name, email, or phone now works as expected.
- Removed leading letter/avatar from customer list display.
- SyncStatus table and Prisma schema are now fully in sync; backend always updates correct table.
- Sync status now updates correctly after each sync; no more perpetual 'Idle' or 'Not Synced'.
- Tooltip in header now shows all sync resources, not just customers.
- Backend and frontend restart scripts improved for cross-platform compatibility.

### Changed
- Backend and frontend code refactored for robust sync status and health reporting.
- Prisma schema and client regenerated and kept in sync with DB.
- Improved error handling and logging for sync jobs and API health.

### Removed
- Deprecated/unused code for customer name display and avatar.
