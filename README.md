[![CI/CD Pipeline](https://github.com/your-org/suitsync_full/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/your-org/suitsync_full/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

**SuitSync** is a full-stack, production-ready application designed to streamline operations for a men's suit shop by providing deep, bidirectional integration with the **Lightspeed X-Series** retail platform. It handles everything from party and appointment management to job tracking, notifications, and analytics, all built on a modern, robust technology stack.

## Technology Stack

### Backend
- **Framework**: Node.js with Express
- **Language**: JavaScript (with JSDoc for type safety)
- **Database ORM**: Prisma
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (recommended) or SQLite (for demo)
- **Authentication**: JWT for staff sessions, OAuth 2.0 for Lightspeed API
- **API**: RESTful API with robust error handling and logging.

### Frontend
- **Framework**: Next.js (React)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui component library
- **State Management**: React Context API & SWR for data fetching
- **UI/UX**: Mobile-first, responsive design with toast notifications and loading skeletons.

### DevOps & Tooling
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for automated linting, testing, and build previews.
- **Package Manager**: `pnpm` (recommended)
- **Testing**: Jest, React Testing Library
- **Linting**: ESLint

## Application Architecture

The project is organized as a monorepo to streamline development and deployment.

- **`/server`**: The Node.js/Express backend application.
    - `controllers/`: Handles incoming API requests, business logic, and responses.
    - `routes/`: Defines all API endpoints and maps them to controllers.
    - `services/`: Contains core business logic modules (e.g., `syncService.js`, `workflowService.js`).
    - `middleware/`: Express middleware for tasks like authentication (`auth.js`).
    - `lightspeedClient.js`: A robust, centralized Axios client for all Lightspeed API communication, featuring automated token refresh and rate limit handling.

- **`/frontend`**: The Next.js/React frontend application.
    - `pages/`: Application routes and views.
    - `components/`: Reusable UI components, including `shadcn/ui` primitives.
    - `lib/`: Utility functions and the frontend API client (`apiClient.ts`).
    - `contexts/`: React contexts for managing global state like authentication.

- **`/prisma`**: Database schema, migrations, and seeding.
    - `schema.prisma`: The single source of truth for all database models and relationships.
    - `migrations/`: Automatically generated SQL migration files.
    - `seed.js`: A script to populate the database with initial data for development and testing.

## Key Features

- **Lightspeed Integration**: Bidirectional data sync for Customers, Products, and Sales. Automatically creates and manages custom fields in Lightspeed.
- **Party & Appointment Management**: Group customers into parties (e.g., for a wedding) and schedule appointments like fittings and pickups.
- **Alteration Job Tracking**: Create and manage alteration jobs linked to specific sale line items, assign them to tailors, and track their status.
- **Automated Notifications**: Utilizes Twilio and SendGrid for sending SMS and email reminders for appointments or job status updates.
- **Authentication**: Secure staff login via JWT and seamless, server-to-server Lightspeed API access via OAuth 2.0.
- **Health & Sync Monitoring**: A dedicated UI in the admin panel to monitor the status of the Lightspeed connection and the health of background sync jobs.

## Local Development Setup

### 1. Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or later)
- `pnpm` package manager (`npm install -g pnpm`)
- A Lightspeed X-Series developer account and API credentials.

### 2. Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-org/suitsync_full.git
cd suitsync_full
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
This command will install dependencies for the root, `/server`, and `/frontend` packages.
```sh
pnpm install
```

### 4. Configure Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the project root. This file is critical for connecting to Lightspeed and other services.
```dotenv
# Lightspeed API Credentials
LS_DOMAIN="your-store" # e.g., "suitsync-demo"
LS_CLIENT_ID="your_lightspeed_client_id"
LS_CLIENT_SECRET="your_lightspeed_client_secret"
LS_REDIRECT_URI="http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback"
LS_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN="your_lightspeed_personal_access_token_for_system_tasks"

# Application Settings
SESSION_SECRET="a_strong_and_long_random_string_for_sessions"
DATABASE_URL="file:./prisma/dev.db" # Use PostgreSQL in production
FRONTEND_URL="http://localhost:3001"
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL="http://localhost:3000/api"

# Notification Services (Optional)
SENDGRID_API_KEY="your_sendgrid_key"
SENDGRID_FROM="notifications@yourdomain.com"
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID="your_twilio_sid"
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN="your_twilio_auth_token"
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER="+15551234567"
```
**Note:** The `LS_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` is used for system-level background tasks like the initial data sync and is recommended for production.

### 5. Initialize the Database
This command runs Prisma migrations to set up your database schema and then runs the seed script to populate it with initial data.
```sh
pnpm db:init
```

### 6. Run the Development Servers
This will start the backend on port 3000 and the frontend on port 3001 concurrently.
```sh
pnpm dev
```
- **Backend API**: `http://localhost:3000`
- **Frontend App**: `http://localhost:3001`

## Scripts and Tooling

- `pnpm dev`: Starts both backend and frontend servers for development.
- `pnpm db:init`: Resets the database, applies migrations, and runs the seed script.
- `pnpm lint`: Runs ESLint on both `/server` and `/frontend`.
- `pnpm test`: Runs Jest tests for both `/server` and `/frontend`.
