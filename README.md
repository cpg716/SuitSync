## Technology Stack

### Backend
- **Framework**: Node.js with Express
- **Language**: TypeScript (with strict type safety)
- **Database ORM**: Prisma
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (recommended)
- **Authentication**: JWT for staff sessions, OAuth 2.0 for Lightspeed API
- **API**: RESTful API with robust error handling and logging.

### Frontend
- **Framework**: Next.js (React)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui component library
- **State Management**: React Context API & SWR for data fetching
- **UI/UX**: Mobile-first, responsive design with toast notifications and loading skeletons.

### DevOps & Tooling
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for automated linting, testing, and build previews.
- **Package Manager**: `pnpm` (recommended)
- **Testing**: Jest, React Testing Library
- **Linting**: ESLint
- **Containerization**: Docker & Docker Compose for local and production environments

---

## Application Architecture

The project is organized as a monorepo to streamline development and deployment.

- **`/backend`**: The Node.js/Express backend application.
    - `controllers/`: Handles incoming API requests, business logic, and responses.
    - `routes/`: Defines all API endpoints and maps them to controllers.
    - `services/`: Core business logic modules (e.g., `syncService.ts`, `notificationService.ts`).
    - `middleware/`: Express middleware for tasks like authentication (`auth.ts`).
    - `lightspeedClient.ts`: Centralized Axios client for all Lightspeed API communication, with automated token refresh and rate limit handling.

- **`/frontend`**: The Next.js/React frontend application.
    - `pages/`: Application routes and views.
    - `components/`: Reusable UI components, including `shadcn/ui` primitives.
    - `lib/`: Utility functions and the frontend API client (`apiClient.ts`).
    - `contexts/`: React contexts for managing global state like authentication.

- **`/backend/prisma`**: Database schema, migrations, and seeding.
    - `schema.prisma`: The single source of truth for all database models and relationships.
    - `migrations/`: Automatically generated SQL migration files.
    - `seed.ts`: Script to populate the database with initial data for development and testing.

## Key Features

- **Lightspeed Integration**: Bidirectional data sync for Customers, Products, and Sales. Automatically creates and manages custom fields in Lightspeed.
- **Party & Appointment Management**: Group customers into parties (e.g., for a wedding) and schedule appointments like fittings and pickups.
- **Alteration Job Tracking**: Create and manage alteration jobs linked to specific sale line items, assign them to tailors, and track their status.
- **Automated Notifications**: Utilizes Twilio and SendGrid for sending SMS and email reminders for appointments or job status updates.
- **Authentication**: Secure staff login via JWT and seamless, server-to-server Lightspeed API access via OAuth 2.0.
- **Health & Sync Monitoring**: A dedicated UI in the admin panel to monitor the status of the Lightspeed connection and the health of background sync jobs.

## üîê Authentication

SuitSync uses **Lightspeed X-Series OAuth 2.0** for secure authentication. Users must have a valid Lightspeed account to access the system.

**Key Features:**
- OAuth 2.0 integration with Lightspeed X-Series
- Session-based authentication with secure cookies
- Role-based access control synced from Lightspeed
- Automatic token refresh and session management
- Development mode with demo users for testing

**üìñ For detailed authentication setup and troubleshooting, see [Authentication Setup Guide](docs/AUTHENTICATION_SETUP.md)**

## Local Development Setup

### 1. Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or later)
- `pnpm` package manager (`npm install -g pnpm`)
- Docker & Docker Compose (for containerized development)
- A Lightspeed X-Series developer account and API credentials.

### 2. Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-org/suitsync_full.git
cd suitsync_full
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
This command will install dependencies for the root, `/backend`, and `/frontend` packages.
```sh
pnpm install
```

### 4. Configure Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the project root with your Lightspeed X-Series credentials:

```bash
# Database
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:postgres@db:5432/suitsync_prod"

# Application
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3001
SESSION_SECRET=your-32-char-secret-here
JWT_SECRET=your-32-char-secret-here

# Lightspeed X-Series API
LS_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
LS_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
LS_ACCOUNT_ID=your_account_id
LS_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback
```

### 5. Initialize the Database
This command runs Prisma migrations to set up your database schema and then runs the seed script to populate it with initial data.
```sh
pnpm db:init
```

### 6. Run the Development Servers
You can run the backend and frontend separately, or use Docker Compose for a fully containerized environment.

#### Option A: Native (host) development
```sh
pnpm dev:server   # Starts backend on :3000
pnpm dev:frontend # Starts frontend on :3001
```

#### Option B: Docker Compose (recommended)
```sh
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build
```
- **Backend API**: `http://localhost:3000`
- **Frontend App**: `http://localhost:3001`

## Docker Usage

- **Local Development:**
  - Use `docker-compose.dev.yml` for a hot-reloading dev environment with backend, frontend, and Postgres containers.
  - All code changes are reflected live via volume mounts.
- **Production:**
  - Use `docker-compose.yml` for a production-like environment. This builds and runs optimized containers for backend, frontend, and database.
  - Ensure all environment variables are set in `.env` and secrets are managed securely.
- **Troubleshooting:**
  - Use `docker-compose logs` to view service logs.
  - If you see migration or session issues, check backend logs and Prisma migration state.
  - For Compose version warnings, update to the latest Compose spec.

## AI-Augmented Workflow

See [docs/AI_WORKFLOW.md](docs/AI_WORKFLOW.md) for best practices on using AI tools (Cursor, Copilot, ChatGPT, etc.) to refactor, debug, and extend SuitSync. Highlights:
- Use AI to review backend and frontend code for compliance, error handling, and integration with Lightspeed.
- Prompt AI to generate or improve tests, documentation, and code modernization.
- Use project-wide search for keywords like `customer`, `group`, `sale`, `commission`, `sync`, `alteration` to audit integration points.

---

## Scripts and Tooling

- `pnpm dev:server`: Starts backend server for development.
- `pnpm dev:frontend`: Starts frontend server for development.
- `pnpm db:init`: Resets the database, applies migrations, and runs the seed script.
- `pnpm lint`: Runs ESLint on both `/backend` and `/frontend`.
- `pnpm test`: Runs Jest tests for both `/backend` and `/frontend`.
